This can be reflected in my educational background; psychology and computer science. The cities I have lived in: Philadelphia, Shanghai, Taipei, and Lyon. And, also my hobbies: language exchange, Muay Thai, jiu-jitsu, photography, making illustrations, coding, and learning more about different cultures.</p>
